RUBY Version: 1.9.3 (this is limited by what cloud9 IDE includes on its servers)

We're going to be creating various coding challanges and answers.

Each file has a goal to complete. As well as some tests to check it's all working.

To run a file just execute it in the command line:
'ruby string_arrays/all_unique.rb'

From Cloud9 just use 'Run >' at the top of the IDE.

This is techically a rails application. The gemfile is included in order to access
some particular rails methods for strings. It's also there to manage the dependecies
of other gems we use to solve some of the harder problems.

The first section will be regarding Strings and Arrays.
